# giskard
Various experiments with [`giskard`](https://docs.giskard.ai/) an open-source framework for testing ML models, from LLMs to tabular models.  Explorations include:

* [giskard-playbook.ipynb](giskard-playbook.ipynb): outline a recipe to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model that answers questions about climate change, based on the 2023 Climate Change Synthesis Report by the IPCC. `giskard` LLM Scan is used to automatically detect issues with the model by generating scan results such as the [hallucination results](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/malminhas/giskard/blob/main/hallucination_results.html) in the notebook.
